## Why I Found It Interesting
I found this article interesting because it lays out clear principles for building scalable and maintainable software-as-a-service apps.  
It emphasizes on separating configuration, treating logs as event streams, and continuous deployment, which is what modern DevOps is essentially about.  
It also gave me insight into why version control and clear workflows are essential for team collaboration.

I like how the article focused on consistency, especially keeping development and production aligned to prevent surprises. It made me appreciate the hidden work behind software that “just works.”

## Why it interested me
I find “Software Projects Don’t Have to Be Late and Costly” interesting because it breaks a stereotype I’ve always heard about software, that projects almost always go wrong. Even from the outside, it’s common to hear stories about apps launching late, systems full of bugs, or teams struggling to meet expectations. What stood out to me in this article is the idea that those problems aren’t inevitable, and that with the right approach, software projects can actually run smoothly and deliver real value. I like this perspective because it makes the field feel less chaotic and more hopeful, showing that challenges can be managed with better planning and collaboration. For someone like me, who hasn’t worked in software but is curious about how it shapes so much of our world, it’s encouraging to see that success in these projects isn’t just luck, it’s something that can be built intentionally.
