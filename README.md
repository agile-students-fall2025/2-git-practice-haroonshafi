## Why I Found It Interesting
I found this article interesting because it lays out clear principles for building scalable and maintainable software-as-a-service apps.  
It emphasizes on separating configuration, treating logs as event streams, and continuous deployment, which is what modern DevOps is essentially about.  
It also gave me insight into why version control and clear workflows are essential for team collaboration.
